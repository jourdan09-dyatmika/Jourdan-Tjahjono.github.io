					<p>The FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) is an auto racing world championship organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).</p>
					<p>It is a series of endurance races featuring multiple classes of cars, including sports prototypes and production-based grand tourers. The series awards world champion titles to the top-scoring drivers and manufacturers over the season. The WEC was first run in 2012 and features races around the world, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 2024, the series will feature two categories: Hypercar and LMGT3.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) is the result of the evolution of sports car racing and endurance racing events. Its history can be traced back to the following championships and series:</p>
					<p>World Sportscar Championship (WSC): The WSC was established in 1953 by the FIA, and it was the first international series dedicated to sports car racing. The WSC ran until 1992, featuring various classes of sports cars, including prototypes and grand tourers. The WSC was known for events like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, 12 Hours of Sebring, and the 24 Hours of Daytona.</p>
					<p>International Sports Racing Series (ISRS): Founded in 1997, the ISRS was a European-based sports car series featuring sports prototype racing cars. The series was initially created to fill the void left by the demise of the WSC.</p>
					<p>FIA Sportscar Championship (FSC): Established in 1997 by the FIA and the RAC Tourist Trophy Trust, the FSC was a sports car racing series with two categories: sports prototypes and grand tourers. The series merged with the ISRS in 2001 to create the FIA Sportscar Championship.</p>
					<p>Le Mans Endurance Series (LMES): Founded by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) in 2004, the LMES was a European-based endurance racing series designed to replace the defunct FIA Sportscar Championship. The LMES featured two classes: LMP1 and LMP2 for sports prototypes, and GT1 and GT2 for grand tourers.</p>
					<p>In 2010, the ACO and the FIA announced the creation of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) to replace the LMES. The WEC was launched in 2012, featuring two classes: LMP1 and LMP2 for sports prototypes, and LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am for grand tourers. The WEC has since become the premier international endurance racing series, featuring the 24 Hours of Le Mans and other iconic endurance races.</p>
					<p>The WEC has seen various iterations in terms of classes and regulations over the years, adapting to changes in technology and the needs of the automotive industry. Most recently, the WEC announced the introduction of the Le Mans Hypercar (LMH) class and the LMGT3 class for the 2024 season.</p>
