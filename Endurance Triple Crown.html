						Timo Bernhard, The last winner of the triple crown</a>
					</div>
					<p>The Endurance Triple Crown in motorsports refers to winning three prestigious endurance races: the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 24 Hours of Daytona, and the 12 Hours of Sebring.</p>
					<p>This achievement has been won by several drivers, including A.J. Foyt, Hans Herrmann, Jackie Oliver, Al Holbert, Hurley Haywood, Mauro Baldi, Andy Wallace, Marco Werner, and Timo Bernhard. Many other drivers have come close to winning the crown with second-place finishes in the third event.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The Endurance Triple Crown in motorsports is an unofficial title achieved by winning three of the most prestigious and challenging endurance races: the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 24 Hours of Daytona, and the 12 Hours of Sebring. The history of this achievement dates back to the 1960s and 1970s when drivers like Ken Miles and Hans Herrmann started winning these races.</p>
					<p>Ken Miles, for instance, had the chance to win all three events in the same year in 1966 but lost the opportunity due to a problem with Ford team orders for a photo finish at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Miles' story was later dramatized in the 2019 film "Ford v Ferrari." Hans Herrmann became the first driver to win the Triple Crown in 1970, while Timo Bernhard is the most recent driver to do so in 2010. As of 2023, only nine drivers have completed the Triple Crown by winning all three races. No driver has won the three events in the same year.</p>
					<p>The 24 Hours of Le Mans, held in France, is the oldest active endurance race in the world, with the first event taking place in 1923. The 24 Hours of Daytona, held in the United States, started in 1962, and the 12 Hours of Sebring, also in the United States, began in 1950. These races test drivers' speed, endurance, reliability, and resolve, as they often face varying weather conditions and must navigate through lapped traffic in different classes of cars.</p>
					<p>The Endurance Triple Crown is an extraordinary accomplishment in motorsports, as winning these races requires not only skill and determination but also the ability to perform consistently over extended periods. It remains one of the most challenging and coveted achievements in the sport.</p>
