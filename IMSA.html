					<p>The IMSA endurance cup is divided into two classes: the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and the Michelin Pilot Challenge. The WeatherTech SportsCar Championship is for prototypes, which are racing cars that are designed to be as aerodynamic as possible. These cars are usually built by manufacturers and are designed to be fast and reliable. The Michelin Pilot Challenge is for Grand Touring cars, which are production-based cars that have been modified for racing. These cars are usually less aerodynamic than prototypes but are still fast and reliable.</p>
					<p>The IMSA endurance cup is a part of the FIA World Endurance Championship, which is a series of endurance races held around the world. The FIA World Endurance Championship is divided into three classes: LMP1, LMP2, and LMGTE.

					<p>The IMSA (International Motor Sports Association) endurance cup is a series of endurance races that has been held in North America since 1971. It is organized by the International Motor Sports Association, which is a sanctioning body for sports car racing in North America.</p>
					<p>The IMSA endurance cup was originally known as the IMSA GT Championship, and it was initially focused on production-based sports cars. In the 1980s, the series began to include prototypes, which are racing cars that are designed to be as aerodynamic as possible. These cars are usually built by manufacturers and are designed to be fast and reliable.</p>
					<p>In the 1990s, the IMSA GT Championship was merged with the World Sportscar Championship, which was a series of endurance races held around the world. The merged series was known as the IMSA World Sportscar Championship, and it included races in North America and Europe. However, the series was discontinued in 1993 due to financial difficulties.</p>
					<p>In 1998, the IMSA endurance cup was revived as the American Le Mans Series, which was focused on prototypes and Grand Touring cars. The series was initially organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, which is the organization that oversees the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The American Le Mans Series was a part of the FIA World Endurance Championship, which is a series of endurance races held around the world.</p>
