					<p>The World Rally Championship (WRC) is an international auto racing series organized by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It is considered the highest class of rally racing, and features drivers and manufacturers from around the world competing on a variety of surfaces, including gravel, tarmac, snow, and ice.</p>
					<p>The series consists of 13 three-day rallies, held in various locations throughout the year. Teams compete in production-based cars that have been modified for rallying, with separate championship titles awarded to drivers, co-drivers, and manufacturers.</p>
					<p>In recent years, the series has seen the introduction of new rules and regulations, including the World Rally Car regulations in 1997 and the new Rally1 regulations in 2022. The WRC is known for its challenging and unpredictable nature, and is popular among fans for its combination of speed, skill, and endurance.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The WRC was formed from well-known international rallies, nine of which were previously part of the International Championship for Manufacturers (IMC), which was contested from 1970 to 1972. The inaugural season of the WRC began with the Monte Carlo Rally on 19 January 1973.</p>
					<p>The first manufacturer's world championship was won by Alpine-Renault with its Alpine A110, and the first drivers' world championship was not awarded until 1979. The 1980s saw the introduction of more powerful four-wheel-drive Group B cars, which were replaced by Group A cars in 1987. The World Rally Car regulations were introduced in 1997, and the series has seen a number of rule changes and the introduction of new technology in the years since.</p>
					<p>Today, the WRC consists of 13 three-day rallies, held in various locations throughout the year. Teams compete in production-based cars that have been modified for rallying, with separate championship titles awarded to drivers, co-drivers, and manufacturers. The series is known for its challenging and unpredictable nature, and is popular among fans for its combination of speed, skill, and endurance.</p>
					<h2>Controversies</h2>
					<p>There have been several controversies in the World Rally Championship (WRC) over the years. Here are a few examples:</p>
					<p>Group B ban: In 1986, the FIA banned Group B cars due to safety concerns after a series of high-profile accidents, including the death of Henri Toivonen and Sergio Cresto in Corsica. The ban was controversial as it ended the era of high-powered and spectacular Group B cars, and many felt that the FIA had acted too hastily.</p>
					<p>Group B was banned as a result of multiple accidents caused by the high powered cars and the actions of fans, at the time of the Group B rally cars, fans often crowded the path, crowds would gather infront of the cars and move out of the way last second and stand at turns where cars would slide sometimes missing them by mere centimetres.</p>
					<p>The fans grouping so close and dangerously lead to accidents where the cars loss control on the tight roads or after a jump and would crash into crowds due to a lack of space for the car to go and the rally paths being tight, winding and at times at the edge of cliffs or in the middle of towns doing tight 90 degree turns and hairpins where cars had to do a full 180 degree turn on dirt or snow.</p>
