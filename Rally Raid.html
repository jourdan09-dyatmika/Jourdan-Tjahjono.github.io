					</div>
					<p>A rally raid is a long-distance off-road racing event that involves crossing rough terrain, such as deserts, dunes, and rocky landscapes. It is a test of endurance, navigation, and driving skills, and often takes place over several days or even weeks, covering thousands of kilometers.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The history of rally raid can be traced back to the early 1900s, soon after automobiles were invented. One of the earliest and most famous examples is the Peking to Paris Race, a competition of 15,000 kilometers between just 11 competitors. Over time, more events, classes, vehicles, and countries began to participate in rally raid, until the sport grew into the modern competition we know today.</p>
					<p>The most famous rally raid event is the Dakar Rally, founded by Thierry Sabine in 1977. The Dakar Rally has become an international and seminal racing event, despite being forced to relocate to South America after some security concerns in the late 2000s. Today, the Dakar Rally is one of the most popular events in all motorsports and across all vehicle classes.</p>
					<p>Inspired by the Dakar Rally, the Africa Eco Race was founded in 2009 to replace the relocated Dakar Rally. The Silk Way Rally is another prominent rally raid event, founded in 2009 and growing in popularity and length since then. Other famous rally raids include the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge, Rallye du Maroc, TransAnatolia Rally Raid, Hellas Rally Raid, Dinaric Rally Raid, Borneo Rally Raid, and Raid De Himalaya.</p>
					<p>In 2022, the World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC) was introduced, replacing both the FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Rallies and FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship. The W2RC is co-sanctioned by the FIA and FIM and promoted by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). The championship includes world championship titles in both automobile and motorcycle categories and covers various categories under both the FIA and FIM.</p>
