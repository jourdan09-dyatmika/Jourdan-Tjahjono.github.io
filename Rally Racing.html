					<p>Rallying is a diverse category of motor racing that encompasses various competitive driving events such as speed tests (also known as "rally racing" in the United States), navigation challenges, and demonstrating the ability to reach specific waypoints or destinations within a set time or average speed. Rallies can range from short trials at a single location to extreme endurance events spanning several thousand miles.</p>
					<p>The organization of rallies can vary based on their format. They may take place on private or public roads, which can be open or closed to traffic. Alternatively, rallies can be held off-road, such as in cross-country or rally-raid events. Competitors have the option to use production vehicles, but these must be street-legal if driven on open roads. For more challenging terrain, specially built competition vehicles are allowed.</p>
					<p>Rallying differs from other motor sports as it does not involve competing against other racers on loops of a track, but rather follows a point-to-point format where participants depart at set intervals from one or multiple starting points.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>Car rally racing has a history that dates back to the late 19th century, with the first automotive race organized by a French cycling magazine in 1887. The first multi-participant race, the Paris-Rouen race, was held in 1894 by the Parisian newspaper Le Petit Journal. The race was 126 miles long and attracted over 100 drivers, although only 26 showed up on race day. The race was won by Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, who drove a steam tricycle.</p>
					<p>The first use of the term "rally" to describe this type of automotive competition came in 1907 with the first Monte Carlo Rally. Rallies were originally organized as reliability trials, with drivers and navigators attempting to keep to a predetermined schedule between checkpoints. The course was generally unknown to contestants until the start of the rally.</p>
					<p>Rally racing gained popularity in the early 20th century, especially in Europe, and international competitions were instituted. The World Rally Championship (WRC) was officially established in 1973, but the sport of rally racing had been taking place long before that.</p>
					<p>The sport of rally racing has seen many changes over the years, including advancements in technology and safety measures. Despite the ban on road racing in many parts of Europe in the early 20th century due to safety reasons, the sport continued to thrive in Italy and other countries. Today, the WRC is the premier rally championship, featuring events and drivers from around the world.</p>
