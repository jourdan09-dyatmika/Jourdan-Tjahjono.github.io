					<p>Formula racing, also known as open-wheel racing in North America, refers to various forms of open-wheeled single-seater motorsport. The term "formula racing" originates from the nomenclature used by the FIA for its single-seater regulations, or formulae, which were established after World War II. Some examples of these formulae include Formula One, Formula E, Formula Two, Formula Three, regional Formula Three, and Formula Four.</p>
					<p>In addition to the formulae regulated by the FIA, other single-seater series are also commonly considered to be part of the formula racing category. These include the IndyCar Series, which is popular in the United States and Canada, and the Super Formula Championship, which is held in Japan.</p>
					<p>In formula racing, the cars are designed with a single seat and exposed wheels, allowing for high speeds and agility. The regulations governing formula racing are strict, with rules governing everything from the size and shape of the chassis and bodywork to the type and quantity of fuel that can be used.</p>
					<p>Formula racing is considered to be one of the most challenging and exciting forms of motorsport, due to the high speeds and intense competition involved. The drivers in these series are some of the most skilled and talented in the world, and the races are often thrilling and unpredictable.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The history of open-wheel racing can be traced back to the early 1900s, with American racecar driver Ray Harroun being an early pioneer of the concept. Prior to World War II, street automobiles generally had wheels that protruded beyond the vehicle's main body, but with the advent of unibody vehicle construction and the desire to improve aerodynamics, the majority of new road-registerable vehicles had wheels that were under the main body of the car by the end of the 1950s.</p>
					<p>The first formula established by the FIA was Formula One, which was introduced in 1946. The inaugural Formula One World Championship was held in 1950, and the series has since become the most prestigious and well-known formula racing series in the world.</p>
					<p>In the following decades, the FIA introduced several other formulae, including Formula Two in 1948, Formula Three in 1950, and Formula Four in 1993. These formulae were established to provide a clear path for drivers to progress through the ranks of formula racing, from entry-level series to the top level of Formula One.</p>
					<p>Since then multiple other series like Formula Renault and national competitions of Formula Four and high class racing series like the U.S IndyCar.</p>
