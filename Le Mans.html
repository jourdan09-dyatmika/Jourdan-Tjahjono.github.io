					<p>The 24 Hours of Le Mans is an annual endurance-focused sports car race that takes place near the town of Le Mans, France. It is one of the most prestigious and famous races in the world, and is one of the races in the unofficial "Triple Crown of motorsport" along with the Monaco Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500. The race is organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and is held on the Circuit de la Sarthe, which is made up of closed public roads and dedicated racing track.</p>
					<p>The race is known for its demanding 24-hour duration, during which teams must balance the need for speed with the cars' reliability and fuel efficiency. The cars that compete in the race are able to reach speeds of up to 366 km/h (227 mph), and have reached a top speed of 407 km/h (253 mph) on the Mulsanne Straight. The race is run in different classes, with cars of similar specification competing against each other while also competing for overall placing amongst all classes.</p>
					<p>The race was originally designed to test the ability of manufacturers to build sporty and reliable cars, rather than just the fastest machines. This has led to the adoption of fuel economy formulae and the use of hybrid systems in the race, which have had a trickle-down effect and have led to the development of faster and more exotic supercars. The race is held in June and is known for its hot and often rainy conditions, as well as its challenging 24-hour duration.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The 24 Hours of Le Mans is an endurance sports car race that has been held annually near Le Mans, France since 1923. It is one of the most prestigious and famous races in the world, and is considered one of the races that makes up the Triple Crown of motorsport, along with the Monaco Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500. The race is organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest and takes place on the Circuit de la Sarthe, which is made up of closed public roads and dedicated racing track.</p>
					<p>The race was originally designed to test the ability of manufacturers to build sporty and reliable cars, rather than just fast cars. This led to innovation in producing reliable and fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as cars with better aerodynamics and stability at high speeds. In the 1970s, the oil crisis led organizers to adopt a fuel economy formula, and while this was later abandoned, fuel efficiency remains an important aspect of the race. Hybrid systems have also been championed in the LMP category.</p>
					<p>The race has been a part of various championships over the years, including the World Sportscar Championship and the FIA World Endurance Championship. It is known for its challenging conditions, with drivers covering over 5,000 km in extreme temperatures and frequently racing for over two hours before a relief driver can take over.</p>
					<p>There are two classes of cars that compete in the race: prototypes and Grand Touring cars. These are further broken down into sub-classes, and teams strive for speed, reliability, and efficiency while avoiding mechanical damage. Competing teams have come from a variety of organizations, including manufacturer-backed teams and amateur teams.</p>
					<p>The race is known for its large number of competitors, with approximately 60 cars taking part each year. It has also been a part of the informal Triple Crown of motorsport and the Triple Crown of endurance racing. In addition to the main race, there have been a number of concept cars and special entries that have participated in the race under the "Garage 56" banner, including the DeltaWing and the Nissan ZEOD RC.</p>
