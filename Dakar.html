					<p>The Dakar Rally, also known as "The Dakar," is an annual rally raid race organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation. It is an off-road endurance event where competitors traverse rough terrains, including dunes, mud, rocks, and erg. The race was first held in 1978 and originally ran from Paris, France to Dakar, Senegal, but due to security threats, it has been held in South America from 2009 to 2019 and in Saudi Arabia since 2020.</p>
					<p>The Dakar Rally is open to both amateur and professional entries, with professionals typically making up around 80% of the participants. The terrain covered in the race is much tougher than conventional rallying, with most of the competitive special sections off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800-900 kilometers (500-560 mi) per day.</p>
					<p>The Dakar Rally features five categories of vehicles: motorcycles, cars, quads, trucks, and Side by Side (SxS) categories. The event is known for its challenging terrain, extreme conditions, and the determination and endurance required of the competitors. Additionally, the rally is considered an incomparable human adventure, attracting competitors from over 60 nationalities.</p>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The Dakar Rally, also known as the Paris-Dakar Rally, is an annual rally raid race that was first organized in 1978 by Thierry Sabine. Sabine got the idea for the race after getting lost in the Ténéré desert during the 1975 "Cote-Cote" Abidjan-Nice rally and deciding that the desert would be a good location for a regular rally. The first rally had 182 vehicles taking the start, with 74 surviving the 10,000-kilometer (6,200 mi) trip to Dakar. Cyril Neveu was the event's first winner, riding a Yamaha motorcycle.</p>
					<p>The race used to start in Paris, France, and finish in Dakar, Senegal, but has been held in South America from 2009 to 2019 and in Saudi Arabia since 2020 due to security threats.</p>
					<p>Over the years, the Dakar Rally has seen many changes and challenges. In 1982, there were 382 racers, more than double the number that took the start in 1979. Neveu won the event for a third time, this time riding a Honda motorcycle, while victory in the car class went to the Marreau brothers, driving a privately entered Renault 20. In 1987, French manufacturer Peugeot arrived and won the event with former World Rally champion Ari Vatanen. The 1988 event reached its zenith in terms of entry numbers, with 603 starters.</p>
					<p>In 1992, the finish line moved to Cape Town, South Africa in a bid to combat a declining number of competitors. Auriol became the first person to win in multiple classes after taking Mitsubishi's second victory in the car class, while Peterhansel successfully defended his motorcycle category title. In 1993, the event was the last to be organised by Gilbert Sabine and the Amaury Sport Organisation took over the following year.</p>
					<p>In 1997, the rally ran exclusively in Africa for the first time, with the route running from Dakar to Agadez, Niger and back to Dakar. Citroën's withdrawal due to a rule change paved the way for Mitsubishi to take a fourth victory. Japan's Kenjiro Shinozuka became the first non-European to win the event. Peterhansel equalled Neveu's record of five motorcycle category wins in 1997, before going one better in 1998.</p>
					<p>In 2001, the rally used the familiar Paris-Dakar route for the final time, and was notable for Mitsubishi's Jutta Kleinschmidt, as she was the first woman to win the rally. The 2002 began in the French town of Arras, and the 2003 rally featured an unorthodox route from Marseille to Sharm El Sheikh.</p>
					<p>The 2008 event was cancelled on 4 January 2008 amid fears of attacks in Mauritania following the 2007 killing of four French tourists. The race has since been held in South America and Saudi Arabia.</p>
