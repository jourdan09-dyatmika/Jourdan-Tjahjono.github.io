					<h2 id="History">History</h2>
					<p>Auto racing has a rich history that dates back to the mid-19th century. The first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred in England in 1867, between Ashton-under-Lyne and Old Trafford, Manchester, a distance of eight miles. The first internal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful gasoline-fueled automobiles.</p>					
					<p>The first organized contest was held in Paris in 1887, and the first motorized race between two vehicles occurred in 1894 in France, from Paris to Rouen. The first American automobile race is generally considered to be the Thanksgiving Day Chicago Times-Herald race of November 1895.</p>					
					<p>The first regular auto racing venue was Nice, France, and the first purpose-built 'banked' motor racing venue was Brooklands in England, both established in the late 1890s. The first international competition, the Gordon Bennett Cup, began in 1900.</p>					
					<p>Major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city, were staged by the French automobile club ACF. However, due to several fatal accidents, open-road racing was banned in France in 1903.</p>					
					<p>The first long-distance automobile race, the 1907 Peking to Paris race, covered 9,317 miles over some of the roughest terrain on Earth. The longest automobile race in history, with Paris as the finish line, was the 1908 New York to Paris Race.</p>					
					<p>Aspendale Racecourse in Australia was the world's first purpose-built motor racing circuit, opening in 1906, and Brooklands in Surrey was the first purpose-built 'banked' motor racing venue, opening in 1907.</p>					
					<p>Auto racing gradually spread to other parts of the British Empire, with the first competition in India held in 1905 by the Motor Union of Western India. Today, auto racing is a popular global sport with various types of races, including Formula One, NASCAR, and IndyCar.</p>					
					<h2 id="Motorsport Triple Crown">Motorsport Triple Crown</h2>
					<p>The Motorsport Triple Crown is a prestigious achievement in auto racing, consisting of three of the most iconic endurance races in the world:</p>
					<p>1. The Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 1, held on the streets of Monte Carlo, Monaco. </p>
					<p>2. The Indianapolis 500 in IndyCar racing, held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, United States.</p>
					<p>3. The 24 Hours of Le Mans in sports car racing, held at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans, France.</p>
					<p>The Monaco Grand Prix is often replaced with the Formula 1 World Driver's Championship making the triple crown even harder to achieve.</p>
					<p>Winning all three races during one's career is considered a remarkable accomplishment, showcasing versatility, skill, and adaptability across different racing disciplines.</p>
					<p>This is the only person to win both versions of the Triple Crown of Motorsport:</p>
